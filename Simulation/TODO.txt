This is not in any particular order:

P - Create a unit test with a checker for the final state of the simulation:
    - all injected transactions were included, and there are no duplicates
    - the state in each rollup matches the transactions. (deposits + L1)
    - L1 height, L2 height, how many reorgs, etc - if the efficiency is below a threashold then something could have happened

P - split blocks into header&payload
-split rollups into header&payload

- make publishing to L1 more random (to simulate aggregators failng to publish)
- bring in core ethereum structures so that the l2 node can understand them
- implement a very basic secret sharing protocol

- use "gauge" instead of stats
- introduce event feeds
- create a Blockchain structure

----
- analyse the pobi round - some inefficient state recalculation for the rollups
- split block and rollup in header and payload

- create an API,
- integrate crypto
- replace the state and transaction execution with code from geth
