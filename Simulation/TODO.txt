This is not in any particular order

- write a checker to make sure that the state in each rollup matches the transactions
- make the state in the rollup smarter and check it against the transactions

- create the L1Node and L2Node types, and mining is a boolean which starts the mining actor

- integrate rlp serialisation
- instead of passing pointers to rollups/blocks/transactions, pass the serialised object
- create an API,
- integrate crypto
- replace the state and transaction execution with code from geth
