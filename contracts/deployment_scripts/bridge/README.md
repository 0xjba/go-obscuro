## Bridge Deployment Scripts

In this folder you can find all the scripts that are used in order to deploy the bridge.
It is split between the `layer1` and `layer2`. 

It depends on the `CrossChainMessenger` deployment from the `core` deployments.

## Requirements

When deploying the `layer2` scripts, a `companionNetwork` is required in order to link the `layer1` and `layer2`
bridge contracts.
